We work in the TOOLS team. The TOOLS team deals with a few different areas.

The dashboard ('TOOLS board') contains all the items for the current sprint.

The dashboard uses the following filter to select the applicable items:
project in (TOOLS, DEVICES, GBG) AND issuetype not in (Precondition,Test,"Test Execution","Test Plan","Test Set","Sub Test Execution") ORDER BY Rank ASC

Please only take a look at the items that are assigned to me (Simon Coelho) and also the unassigned items in the sprint.
