Take a look at our (the TOOLS team) current sprint using the Jira tool.

The dashboard ('TOOLS board') contains all the items for the current sprint.
The dashboard uses the following filter to select the applicable items:
project in (TOOLS, DEVICES, GBG) AND issuetype not in (Precondition,Test,"Test Execution","Test Plan","Test Set","Sub Test Execution") ORDER BY Rank ASC

Please only take a look at the items that are assigned to me (Simon Coelho) and also the unassigned items in the sprint.

For any of the items that are currently assigned to me AND not done, examine the items for next steps. If the item is a bug, examine the Zendesk comments to see if there has been any movement.

Plan out some things to do today to get those items moving.

Once you have planned them out, add them to the Notion Tasks list for the day using the Notion tool that you have.
